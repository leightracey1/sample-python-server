# sample-python-server

This is a sample python server that I built for a friend. A friend of mine has a python script they wanted to run on a server, but did not know how to accept data from a basic html form and then use it in their application.

The server has two REST endpoints, a GET endpoint that returns the html document to the browser, and a POST request that accepts form data.
